# Angular Template

This is a template I am developing/using for bootstrapping AngularJs 1.x apps.

The goal is to have a clean template that can be used as a base for starting a new project.

By no mean complete or well structured and still work in progress.

## To Install

- `$ npm install`
- `$ bower install`

## To Run:

Run:

- `$ grunt watch`

and make your changes.



##Â TODO
- Add Serice/Factory example
- Cleanup Gruntfile.js
- SCSS compilation review
